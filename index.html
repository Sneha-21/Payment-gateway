      <h2>Campaign Story</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In today’s fast-paced and dynamic world education is one of the most
        promising practices to ensure that we establish an effectively shaped
        society and hence a developed country. But do you believe that every
        child in India has the chance to pursue their educational goals? Do they
        have access to basic education, let alone a degree? The answer in your
        mind is probably, NO! According to a recent Oxford University report,
        around 51% of Indian students drop out by the age of 19. The reasons
        vary from lack of educational infrastructure to forced child labour or
        bonded labour. But the primary cause is poverty. For a developing
        country like India, we need to streamline our actions to upkeep with our
        high educational standards. Nelson Mandela once said - “Education is the
        most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” The
        underprivileged children in India need our support to hold this weapon
        of education in their fight against poverty, and hunger. We firmly
        support the education of such underprivileged children who cannot
        acquire their very own right to education. Children from rural areas,
        especially, need your support. With the correct support system in place,
        they will bloom like a flower and achieve their ambitions. We need your
        help to accomplish this goal of educating numerous underprivileged
        children. They hold the future of our country in their hands and their
        education should not stop at any cost. Let’s join hands to help our
        younger citizens to steer their future to great heights!
